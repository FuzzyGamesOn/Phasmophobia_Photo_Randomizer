## I love this! How can I support its development?
Thank you! Every little bit of support helps me to continue to develop free-to-use projects like this, so [it'd be awesome if you bought me a coffee to say thanks](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/fuzzygames)! <3

This project does not reuse any assets, code, or other exclusive resources from the game Phasmophobia. This project is a supplementary free-to-use tool created with text and thumbnail references to the items and other concepts referenced in the game. For the purposes of classification, this project/tool is a randomizer tracking program for the game and, as such, does not modify anything about the game executable or the game's included files -- much like other randomizer tracking programs created for other games.
